<h1>The Best Movies According to Yasuko</h1>
<br/>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time. (Project)</h2>
<! Please, describe the movies in the afternoon as a homework>
<hr/>
<h3>Doctor Zhivago</h3>
<p>This film retains all its romance and mystery even after 
    all these years--Christie and Sharif are so beautiful 
    to see and the acting and scenery absolutely captivating.</p>   
<br>
<h3>Carrie by Stephen King</h3>
<p>Between scenography and music it cause all my attention how fantastic job did the production of this movie.</p>
<br/>
<h3>The Age of Innocence by Martin Scorsese.</h3>
<p>This movie impressed by how accurately the screenplay (by Jay Cocks and Scorsese) reflects the book. 
    I liked how the production madea a nice work in the scenary of the film.</p>
